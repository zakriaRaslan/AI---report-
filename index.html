                What is Artificial Intelligence?
            </h3>
            <p>
                In engineering, computing (AI), sometimes called machine
                intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in
                contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and
                animals.<br />Leading AI textbooks define the sector because the
                study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its
                environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of
                successfully achieving its goals.<br />Colloquially, the term
                "artificial intelligence" is commonly accustomed describe
                machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that
                humans go along with the human mind, like "learning" and
                "problem solving".
            </p>

            <p>
                Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in
                1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of
                optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding ,
                followed by new success and renewed funding.<br />For most of
                its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that
                fail to communicate with each other.<br />These sub-fields are
                based on technical considerations, such as particular goals
                (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular
                tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep
                philosophical differences.<br />Sub-fields have also been based
                on social factors (particular institutions or the work of
                particular researchers).
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>How did it start?</h3>
            <p>
                The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth in
                1956, where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by
                John McCarthy to tell apart the sphere from cybernetics and
                escape the influence of the cyberneticist Wiener.<br />Attendees
                Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT),
                Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders
                and leaders of AI research.<br />They and their students
                produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":
                computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954)(and by
                1959 were reportedly playing better than the common
                human),solving word problems in algebra, proving logical
                theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking
                English.<br />By the center of the 1960s, research within the
                U.S.<br />was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and
                laboratories had been established round the world. AI's founders
                were optimistic about the future: Herbert Simon predicted,
                "machines are capable, within twenty years, of doing any work
                someone can do".<br />Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, "within a
                generation ... the matter of constructing 'artificial
                intelligence' will substantially be solved"
