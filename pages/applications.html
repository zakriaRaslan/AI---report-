            <h3>Healthcare</h3>
            <p>
                AI in healthcare is usually used for classification, whether to
                automate initial evaluation of a CT scan or EKG or to spot
                high-risk patients for population health.<br>The breadth of
                applications is rapidly increasing. As an example, AI is being
                applied to the high-cost problem of dosage issues—where findings
                suggested that AI could save $16 billion.<br>In 2016, a
                groundbreaking study in California found that a mathematical
                formula developed with the assistance of AI correctly determined
                the accurate dose of immunosuppressant drugs to present to organ
                patients. X-ray of a hand, with automatic calculation of age by
                computer software Artificial intelligence is assisting doctors.<br>
                in keeping with Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI
                to assist doctors find the correct treatments for cancer.<br>There
                could be a great deal of research and medicines developed
                regarding cancer. In detail, there are over 800 medicines and
                vaccines to treat cancer.<br>This negatively affects the doctors,
                because there are too many options to settle on from, making it
                tougher to settle on the correct drugs for the patients.<br>
                Microsoft is functioning on a project to develop a machine
                called "Hanover".<br> Its goal is to memorize all
                the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which
                combinations of medicine are going to be best for every patient.<br>
                One project that's being worked on at the instant is fighting
                myelocytic leukemia, a fatal cancer where the treatment has not
                improved in decades.<br>Another study was reported to possess found
                that computer science was pretty much as good as trained doctors
                in identifying skin cancers.<br>Another study is using computer
                science to undertake to observe multiple high-risk patients, and
                this can be done by asking each patient numerous questions
                supported data acquired from live doctor to patient
                interactions.<br>One study was finished transfer learning, the
                machine performed a diagnosis similarly to a well-trained
                ophthalmologist, and will generate a choice within 30 seconds on
                whether or not the patient should be referred for treatment,
                with over 95% accuracy.

            <h3>Automotive</h3>
            <p>
                Advancements in AI have contributed to the expansion of the
                automotive industry through the creation and evolution of
                self-driving vehicles. As of 2016, there are over 30 companies
                utilizing AI into the creation of self-driving cars.<br>some
                companies attached AI include Tesla, Google, and Apple. Many
                components contribute to the functioning of self-driving cars.<br>
                These vehicles incorporate systems like braking, lane changing,
                collision prevention, navigation and mapping.<br>Together, these
                systems, also as high-performance computers, are integrated into
                one complex vehicle.<br>Recent developments in autonomous
                automobiles have made the innovation of self-driving trucks
                possible, though they're still within the testing phase.<br>the
                united kingdom government has passed legislation to start
                testing of self-driving truck platoons in 2018.Self-driving
                truck platoons are a fleet of self-driving trucks following the
                lead of 1 non-self-driving truck, that the truck platoons aren't
                entirely autonomous yet.<br>Meanwhile, the Daimler, a German
                automobile corporation, is testing the Freightliner Inspiration
                which could be a semi-autonomous truck which will only be used
                on the highway.

                Finance and economics
            </h3>
            <p>
                Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network
                systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm,
                flagging these for human investigation. the employment of AI in
                banking are often traced back to 1987 when Security Pacific
                commercial bank in US set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to
                counter the unauthorized use of debit cards.<br>Programs like
                Kasisto and Moneystream are using AI in financial services.<br>
                Banks use computer science systems today to arrange operations,
                maintain book-keeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties.<br>
                AI can react to changes overnight or when business isn't going
                down.<br>In August 2001, robots beat humans in an exceedingly
                simulated financial trading competition. AI has also reduced
                fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns of
                users for any abnormal changes or anomalies.<br>AI is increasingly
                being employed by corporations. Jack Ma has controversially
                predicted that AI CEO's are 30 years away.<br>The use of AI
                machines within the market in applications like online trading
                and higher cognitive process has changed major economic
                theories.<br>for instance, AI-based buying and selling platforms
                have changed the law of supply and demand in this it's now
                possible to simply estimate individualized demand and provide
                curves and thus individualized pricing.<br>Furthermore, AI machines
                reduce information asymmetry within the market and thus making
                markets more efficient while reducing the amount of trades.<br>
                Furthermore, AI within the markets limits the results of
                behavior within the markets again making markets more efficient.<br>
                Other theories where AI has had impact include in rational
                choice, rational expectations, theory of games, Lewis turning
                point, portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking In
                August 2019, the AICPA introduced AI training course for
                accounting professionals.

                Cybersecurity
            </h3>
            <p>
                The cybersecurity arena faces significant challenges within the
                style of large-scale hacking attacks of various types that harm
                organizations of every kind and make billions of dollars in
                business damage.<br>computing and language Processing (NLP) has
                begun to be employed by security companies - as an example, SIEM
                (Security Information and Event Management) solutions.<br>The more
                advanced of those solutions use AI and NLP to automatically sort
                the information in networks into high risk and low-risk
                information.<br>this permits security teams to concentrate on the
                attacks that have the potential to try and do real harm to the
                organization, and not become victims of attacks like Denial of
                Service (DoS), Malware et al..
