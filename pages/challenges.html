            <h3>Reasoning, problem solving</h3>
            <p>
                Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated
                step-by-step reasoning that humans use after they solve puzzles
                or make logical deductions.<br />
                By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods
                for handling uncertain or incomplete information, employing
                concepts from probability and economics.<br />These algorithms
                proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems
                because they experienced a "combinatorial explosion": they
                became exponentially slower because the problems grew larger.<br />In
                fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that
                early AI research was ready to model. They solve most of their
                problems using fast, intuitive judgments.
            </p>
            <h3>Knowledge representation</h3>
            <p>
                Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering are central
                to classical AI research, some "expert systems" try to gather
                together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow
                domain.<br>additionally, some projects try to gather the
                "commonsense knowledge" known to the typical person into a
                database containing extensive knowledge about the globe.<br>Among
                the items a comprehensive commonsense cognitive content would
                contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations
                between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and
                effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we all know about what
                others know); and plenty of other, less well researched domains.<br>
                A representation of "what exists" is an ontology: the set of
                objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described
                so software agents can interpret them.<br>The semantics of those
                are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and
                individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties,
                and individuals within the Web Ontology Language.<br>the
                foremost general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which
                try to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by
                acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover
                specific knowledge a couple of particular cognitive content
                (field of interest or area of concern).<br>Such formal knowledge
                representations is utilized in content-based indexing and
                retrieval, scene interpretation,clinical decision support,
                knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable
                inferences from large databases), and other areas.<br>Among the
                foremost difficult problems in knowledge representation are:
                Default reasoning and therefore the qualification problem.

            <h3>
                Planning
            </h3>
            <p>
                Intelligent agents must be ready to set goals and achieve them,
                they have the way to visualise the future—a representation of
                the state of the planet and be ready to make predictions about
                how their actions will change it—and be ready to make choices
                that maximize the utility (or "value") of obtainable choices.<br>In
                classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it's the
                sole system acting within the world, allowing the agent to make
                sure of the results of its actions.However, if the agent isn't
                the sole actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under
                uncertainty.<br>This entails an agent that may not only assess its
                environment and make predictions but also evaluate its
                predictions and adapt supported its assessment.<br>Multi-agent
                planning uses the cooperation and competition of the many agents
                to realize a given goal.<br>Emergent behavior like this can be
                employed by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence.

                Learning
            </h3>
            <p>
                Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research
                since the field's inception,is the study of computer algorithms
                that improve automatically through experience.<br>Unsupervised
                learning is that the ability to search out patterns during a
                stream of input, without requiring a personality's to label the
                inputs first.<br>Supervised learning includes both classification
                and numerical regression, which needs a personality's to label
                the input file first.<br>Classification is employed to see what
                category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees
                variety of samples of things from several categories.<br>Regression
                is that the try and produce a function that describes the
                connection between inputs and outputs and predicts how the
                outputs should change because the inputs change.<br>Both
                classifiers and regression learners is viewed as "function
                approximators" trying to be told an unknown (possibly implicit)
                function; as an example, a spam classifier is viewed as learning
                a function that maps from the text of an email to at least one
                of two categories, "spam" or "not spam".<br>Computational learning
                theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by
                sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other
                notions of optimization.<br>In reinforcement learning the agent is
                rewarded permanently responses and punished for bad ones. The
                agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to create a
                method for operating in its problem space.
