        </div>

            <h3>Search and optimization</h3>
            <p>
                The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth in
                1956, where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by
                John McCarthy to tell apart the sphere from cybernetics and
                escape the influence of the cyberneticist Wiener.<br />Attendees
                Allen Newell (CMU), Herbert Simon (CMU), John McCarthy (MIT),
                Marvin Minsky (MIT) and Arthur Samuel (IBM) became the founders
                and leaders of AI research.<br />They and their students
                produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":
                computers were learning checkers strategies (c. 1954)(and by
                1959 were reportedly playing better than the common
                human),solving word problems in algebra, proving logical
                theorems (Logic Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking
                English.<br />By the center of the 1960s, research within the
                U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and
                laboratories had been established round the world. AI's founders
                were optimistic about the future: Herbert Simon predicted,
                "machines are capable, within twenty years, of doing any work
                someone can do".<br />Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, "within a
                generation ... the matter of constructing 'artificial
                intelligence' will substantially be solved"
            </p>
            <h3>Logic</h3>
            <p>
                Logic is employed for knowledge representation and problem
                solving, but it are often applied to other problems
                similarly.<br />
                for instance, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and
                inductive logic programming could be a method for learning.<br />
                Several different varieties of logic are employed in AI
                research.<br />Propositional logic involves truth functions like
                "or" and "not".<br />First-order logic adds quantifiers and
                predicates, and might express facts about objects, their
                properties, and their relations with one another.<br />Fuzzy
                pure mathematics assigns a "degree of truth" (between 0 and 1)
                to vague statements like "Alice is old" (or rich, or tall, or
                hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely
                true or false.<br />
                mathematical logic is successfully employed in control systems
                to permit experts to contribute vague rules like "if you're near
                the destination station and moving fast, increase the train's
                brake pressure"; these vague rules can then be numerically
                refined within the system.<br />mathematical logic fails to
                scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the
                validity of chaining fuzzy-logic inferences.

            <h3>
                Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning
            </h3>
            <p>
                Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning,
                perception, and robotics) require the agent to control with
                incomplete or uncertain information.<br />AI researchers have
                devised variety of powerful tools to resolve these problems
                using methods from applied mathematics and economics.<br />Bayesian
                networks are a really general tool which will be used for
                various problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference
                algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization
                algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception
                (using dynamic Bayesian networks).<br />Probabilistic algorithms
                also can be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and
                finding explanations for streams of information, helping
                perception systems to investigate processes that occur over time
                (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).<br />Compared
                with formal logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally
                expensive.<br />
                For inference to be tractable, most observations must be
                conditionally independent of 1 another.<br />Complicated graphs
                with diamonds or other "loops" (undirected cycles) can require a
                classy method like Markoff process town, which spreads an
                ensemble of random walkers throughout the Bayesian network and
                attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional
                probabilities.<br />Bayesian networks are used on Xbox Live to
                rate and match players; wins and losses are "evidence" of how
                good a player is[citation needed].<br />AdSense uses a Bayesian
                network with over 300 million edges to find out which ads to
                serve.

            <h3>
                Classifiers and statistical learning methods
            </h3>
            <p>
                The simplest AI applications is divided into two types:
                classifiers ("if shiny then diamond") and controllers ("if shiny
                then pick up").<br>Controllers do, however, also classify
                conditions before inferring actions, and thus classification
                forms a central a part of many AI systems.<br>Classifiers are
                functions that use pattern matching to see a closest match, they
                will be tuned in step with examples, making them very attractive
                to be used in AI.<br>These examples are referred to as observations
                or patterns, in supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a
                particular predefined class.<br>a category is seen as a call that
                should be made, all the observations combined with their class
                labels are referred to as an information set.<br>When a brand new
                observation is received, that observation is assessed supported
                previous experience.<br>A classifier is trained in various ways;
                there are many statistical and machine learning approaches, the
                choice tree is probably the foremost widely used machine
                learning algorithm.<br>Other widely used classifiers are the neural
                network, k-nearest neighbor algorithm,kernel methods like the
                support vector machine (SVM),Gaussian mixture model,and the
                extremely popular naive Bayes classifier.<br>Classifier performance
                depends greatly on the characteristics of the info to be
                classified, like the dataset size, distribution of samples
                across classes, the dimensionality, and therefore the level of
                noise.<br>Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model
                is a very good acceptable the particular data, Otherwise, if no
                matching model is out there, and if accuracy (rather than speed
                or scalability) is that the sole concern, conventional wisdom is
                that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more
                accurate than model-based classifiers like "naive Bayes" on most
                practical data sets.
